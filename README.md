# GenesisBook Portfolios

This repository contains the personal portfolio websites of the GenesisBook team. This project was created as part of the User Experience Design curriculum for Semester 4 at the [MIT Institute of Design, Pune](https://www.mitid.edu.in/).

## About the Project

<img width="3368" height="2380" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7f88bdde-2f6f-4fff-b454-254795f3206a" />

This project is a collection of individual portfolio websites created by a team of four UX design students. The entire project, from learning the necessary coding skills to designing and developing the final websites, was completed from scratch within one month. Each team member first created their own portfolio, after which the team collaborated to integrate them into a single, cohesive website, along with shared pages like the "About Us" and contact sections.

2.  **Start XAMPP**: Open the XAMPP control panel and start the **Apache** server.
3.  **Copy Files**: Place the entire project folder into the `htdocs` directory within your XAMPP installation folder.
4.  **Access the Websites**: Open your web browser and navigate to the following URLs:
    * **About Page**: `http://localhost/allFiles/GenesisBook/aboutus.html`
